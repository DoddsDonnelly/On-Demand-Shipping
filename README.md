# On-Demand-Shipping-Widget
This is a widget design that will be used in conjunction with a complex web app.  

The complex app has a large scss base, and this widget needed to utilize some of those file so that it stays consistent with the look and feel of the project as a whole.  It also served to reduce any repetition. 

It is for those reasons that there is scss included that may not be necessary for this particular widget.  I have tried to comment out and exclude partials that are not needed but there is still quite a bit of code contained within some of these files that is simply not needed.  

Maybe one day when I have more time I might clean it up a bit.

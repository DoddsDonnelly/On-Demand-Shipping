# On-Demand-Shipping
This is an on demand shipping design that will be used in conjunction with a complex web app.  

The complex app has a large scss base, and this design needed to utilize some of those file in orderer to stay consistent with the look and feel of the project.

It is for those reasons that there is scss included that may not be necessary for this particular widget.  I have tried to comment out and exclude partials that are not needed but there is still quite a bit of code contained within some of these files that is simply not needed.  

Maybe one day when I have more time I might clean it up a bit.
